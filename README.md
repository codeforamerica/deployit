Deploy-It
=========

A git and S3-based deployer for basic websites.

Installation
------------

Deploy-It is a [Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application.

Currently, Deploy-It is being written and not yet functional, but you can create
a [virtual environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/) with all dependencies from
`requirements.txt` by running `make` and activating the environment:

In bash:

1. `make`
2. `source venv-deployit/bin/activate`
3. `python app.py` (not yet working)
